A few resources related to teaching


 ## Resources:
 
 * [**Slideshow:**](https://travisa9.github.io/KinderKids/ "The website") This is just to show the art my kids have done in class. 
 * [**Crazy Phrase Generator:**](https://travisa9.github.io/KinderKids/Crazy%20Art.html "WIP") This is a useful tool for teaching. It will generate unique, funny sentences and phrases to use for drawing ideas or other things.
 * [**Market Equilibrium Simulator:**](https://travisa9.github.io/KinderKids/MarketEqualibrium.html "Cool beans!") Simple simulation of ecconomic forces which lead to equilibrium. User can set variables such as number of agents (buyers, sellers), expectation, production cost and limit. Would be cool to flesh this out a bit more sometime.


 ## PDF Extractor:

All you have to do is press `Ctrl+Shift + i` to open console paste the code into the js console and while the desired PDF is loading press Enter. This will create the controls you need. Please be aware that PDF pages are only generated as you scroll through the document, so you may need to scroll down a bit and then save newly generated files until the entire document has been saved. The code is here:
