A few resources related to teaching


 ## Resources:
 
 * **Slideshow:** This is just to show the art my kids have done in class. [Go ahead and check it out.](https://travisa9.github.io/KinderKids/ "The website")
 * **Simulated Ecconomy:** Comming soon... I have to find where I put the code.
 * **Crazy Phrase Generator:** This is a useful tool for teaching. It will generate unique, funny sentences and phrases to use for drawing ideas or other things. Go to [CrazyPhrases page](https://github.com/TravisA9/KinderKids/blob/main/docs/Crazy%20Art.html "WIP")


 ## PDF Extractor:
 
  * **PDF to images hack:** This is a chunk of code you can use to download PDFs as high quality images from websites that use a popular system for displaying PDFs. All you have to do is press ```ctrl + Shift + I``` to open console paste the code into the js console and while the desired PDF is loading press Enter. This will create the controls you need. Please be aware that PDF pages are only generated as you scroll through the document, so you may need to scroll down a bit and then save newly generated files until the entire document has been saved. The code is here: [pdfHackMultiple.js](https://github.com/TravisA9/KinderKids/blob/main/docs/pdfHackMultiple.js "Paste to js Consol")
